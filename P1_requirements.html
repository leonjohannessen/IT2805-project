            We will work with Da Carlo catering. They are a small firm located in Oslo doing catering for people. They deliver delicious Mediterranean and South American food. They are also in a search for a bigger company where they could start making a canteen operational.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are a small group of professional chefs that take great pride in delivering delicious, savory food with inspiration from their home country. The chefs are born in Chile, Uruguay and Italy and brings this food tradition to Norway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our main contact is Lene Harbo, which handles the administrative operations. The manager, Juan Carlos Pequeno, will also give feedback on the website.

            Until now, Da Carlo have only marketed themselves through word of mouth, but from now on they are focusing on expanding their business by increasing the number of sales. As a part of their marketing strategy they would like to create a website that will give them a presence in the digital world. This will make it easier for potential customer to understand who they are and what they can deliver. Through the website the customers will be assured that Da Carlo will give a great food experience. The website will also make it easier for customers to get in contact with Da Carlo and share it with friends, colleagues and family.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a catering business they want to distinguish themselves by giving a full experience, not just food in aluminium baskets. The chefs deliver the food themself, they present their own artwork with pride and joy for the whole party. They will deliver great food experiences, with a  total experience that gives the customer a wow-feeling and a feeling that they are taken care of.

            The client wants to capture a large user group with the website design and appearance. The website should persuade the customers that Da Carlo will give them great food for their special happening.
          </p>
          <h3>Values</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Latin</li>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Exciting experience</li>
            <li>Memorable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The website should feel personal, warm and genuine. It should communicate that the food is made by great ingredients by chefs that are delighted to make outstanding food. The website should communicate the chefs personalities. It is not the kind of business that will use “highclass”, “feinsmecker” words to describe the food. It is real, genuine food, made by real, genuine chefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company already have a logo and a limited style guide including colors and some graphical elements. They want to keep the logo, but we are free to explore the aesthetic possibilities.

            Da Carlo delivers a bit of luxury and enjoyment to the people on their special event (PRØVE Å SI HER: litt luksus til “gjennomsnittsmennesket”, eller til “folket”, vanlige folk. Finner ikke en god måte)))). To better describe what kind of people the client wants to reach out to, we made three different personas. Personas are a description of one person, that can represent the customers different market segmentations. They help us as web designers to map out the different needs and wants the different kind of customers.
          </p>
          <h3>Personas</h3>
          <p>
            Together with the client we have developed three personas to represent the user group blablabla.
