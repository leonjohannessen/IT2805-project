			We will work with Da Carlo catering. They are a small firm located in Oslo providing catering for people. They deliver delicious Mediterranean and South American food. They are also in a search for a bigger company where they could start making a canteen operational.           </p>

        <h2>Goal &amp; Purpose</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The website’s purpose is to give Da Carlo a presence in the digital world, as part of a marketing strategy to expand their business by increasing the number of sales. Thus, our goal is to inform potential customers of who Da Carlo are, what they can deliver and how to contact them. We also want to help Da Carlo distinguish themselves and assure their audience that they deliver not only great food, but full food experiences. The main audience will be people who demand a little extra luxury on their special event - organizers both of business events and of private parties of different sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a catering business they want to distinguish themselves by giving a full experience, not just food in aluminium baskets. The chefs deliver the food themselves, they present their own artwork with pride and joy for the whole party. They want to deliver great food experiences, with a total experience that gives the customer a wow-feeling and a feeling that they are taken care of.

        <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Navigation of Da Carlo’s website is concise and effective. The site comprises of five main pages: Hjem, Kantine, Kontakt, Om DaCarlo and Catering. All of these can be reached from any other page through a global horizontal navigation bar, always visible in the top of the browser window. This allows users to retain an overview of the website structure at all times, and leaves freedom to move about and find any information quickly. All pages also feature a similar navigation footer in the bottom. The low number of pages makes the navigation bars easy to scan and directly corresponds to the areas of information the client wants to convey, as well as the amount of information within them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the content of specific pages links to other related pages. This makes up a local and more content driven level of navigation. For example, the different sections of the home page link to all of the other pages in turn, while both Kantine, Catering and Om Da Carlo logically have a bottom contact banner linking to the contact page.
          </p>

      </section>
      <section id="brand">
        <h2>Page Layout &amp;&nbsp;Appearance</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The page will have an universal graphic appearance to show the users that they are still on the same website. This will consist of the same fonts, same effect on pictures and layout principles. It is important to us that we keep in mind our clients value words that he wants the website to match:
          </p>
          <h3>Value words</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Latin</li>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Exciting experience</li>
            <li>Memorable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The website should feel personal, warm and genuine. It should communicate that the food is made by ingredients of high quality, by chefs who are delighted to make outstanding food. The website should communicate the chefs’ personalities. It is not the kind of business that will use “highclass”, “feinsmecker” words to describe their food. It is real, genuine food, made by real, genuine chefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company already has a logo and a limited style guide including colors and some graphical elements. They want to keep the logo, but we are free to explore the aesthetic possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moodboard shows an overall look of a possible aesthetic direction for the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Moodboard</h3>
          <figure class="full">
            <img src="img/moodboard_DaCarlo.png" alt="moodboard" />
            <figcaption>Moodboard created together with the client</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <div class="full-width">
            <div class="left">
              <h3>Layout</h3>
              <p>
                We want longer, but fewer pages to avoid too many clicks. All pages of our website consist of some common content. This includes the logo of Da Carlo Catering, which will be displayed on the top of every page. Behind the logo will be a photograph, “Main Picture” this will be different for every page, but have in common that they work as the background for the whole page, not changing as the user scrolls down the page. On the main page, the main picture will also be a picture carousel. The height of the image will always be the height of the viewport, minus the navbar. The picture will be centered on the page, so that the center of the image is visible on smaller displays.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was important for our client that the website provide clear and easy access to the information about Da Carlo as a company and the services that they provide. We have placed the navigation bar under the main picture to give a clear overview of what this website contains as well as easy access to the different underlying pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to create a wow-factor for Da Carlo’s potential customers, and we think by designing a modern layout with information in boxes that slide over bigger pictures, we will capture the users eyes compared to other catering firms’ websites. Some of the boxes will have a texture to make the information “pop”. Although it is important that the page don’t feel dated, we want to reach out to a broad audience and we want to make the design feel including.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every page will include the navbar, a segment about contact information and a footer. The only exception here is the “Kontakt oss” page where the contact information naturally will take up not just a segment of the page, but the whole page. The fact that contact information is available on all the pages of the site will help fulfill the goal of making contact information easily accessible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The page will be responsive in the way that the navbar should become a hamburger menu when the viewport is less than a smartphone: 344px (or percentage). The boxes will then fill the viewport, however you can still see the main picture in the background as the boxes scroll over it.

              <strong>Font:</strong> Lora for body text and Lato for headers<br>
              <strong>Colours:</strong> HEX: #009998 : Turqoise, as a contrast colour to be able to control the users focus on the page. This is the colour that is in Da Carlo’s logo. <br>
              <strong>Text:</strong> We want the pictures to speak for themselves so we don’t want the text be too long on each page.<br>
              <strong>Filters: </strong>The main pictures will be different on each page. However, the pictures will have a dark filter to make the logo “pop” and to have a continuous “feel” throughout the whole webpage.

            <img src="img/Webtek_HOME.png">
            <figcaption>Mockup for index.html</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>

We will also include a short text about Da Carlo alongside a photograph of the chef. 
		  </p>
          <p>
		  This page will reach the goal of inspiring the users and making them hungry by using a background photo of savoury food. It will also, through the intro text, communicate Da Carlos passion for cooking and serving great food. By having short introductions to the other parts of the webpage on the “Hjem” page we also quickly introduce the user to Da Carlo as a company and what services they can provide.

          <h3>2. <i>Catering</i> - catering.html</h3>
          <figure class="figure aside mockup">
            <img src="img/Webtek_CATERING.png">
            <figcaption>Mockup for catering.html</figcaption>
          </figure>

It will also include Da Carlos menus. Each menu will have it’s own description text and information about the different courses, ingredients and allergens. There will also be an option to download menus in PDF-format.

		  The menus will be displayed using a tabbed menu panel. This means that only one menu will be visible at the time and the user can “flip” through the menus using the panel buttons. This will be accomplished using Javascript.

          <figure class="figure aside mockup">
            <img src="img/Webtek_KANTINE.png">
            <figcaption>Mockup for kantine.html</figcaption>
          </figure>
		  <p>
		  This page will consist of an introductory text about Da Carlos canteen experience and references from their former employers. This will help reach the goal of informing the user that Da Carlo is an experienced and professional canteen operator. 		  
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  It will also include a list of qualities da carlo can provide in their canteen operations. The “Kantine” page will have a reference from their former client Nets at Strømmen, including a picture, and Nets at Nydalen, also including a picture. We also want to include highlighted quotes from both the clients.

		  <h3>4. <i>Om</i> - om.html</h3>
          <figure class="figure aside mockup">

		  The “Om” page will include a short introductory text about Da Carlo and their vision for their cooking, both in terms of their catering business and the canteen operation. It will also include a short introduction about each chef. This will be their name, a few sentences about them and a picture of them. We hope that this introduction of the chefs will give the visitors the feeling that Da Carlo is a warm and personal company that delivers services to match this. At the bottom of the “Om” page we will embed a video from youtube of food being made by the chefs to enhance the feeling of a personal bond between the chefs and the visitor.</p>

		  This page will have a personal greeting from Da Carlo with their telephonenumber next to it. We hope this greeting will help meet the goal of giving the user a feeling that contacting Da Carlo is a personal and warm experience. The rest of the page will be a form to fill out to get a price estimate from Da Carlo. This form will be dependent on whether the user chooses that they want an estimate for canteen operation or catering.

		  Only one form will be visible at a time, this will be accomplished using tabbed panels and Javascript. The information the user is requested to fill in will validated through the use of Javascript.
