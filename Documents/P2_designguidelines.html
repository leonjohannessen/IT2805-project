			We will work with Da Carlo catering. They are a small firm located in Oslo providing catering for people. They deliver delicious Mediterranean and South American food. They are also in a search for a bigger company where they could start making a canteen operational.           </p>

          <p>

The chefs deliver the food themselves, they present their own artwork with pride and joy for the whole party. They want to deliver great food experiences, with a total experience that gives the customer a wow-feeling and a feeling that they are taken care of.

        <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Navigation of Da Carlo’s website is concise and effective. The site comprises of five main pages: Hjem, Kantine, Kontakt, Om DaCarlo and Catering. All of these can be reached from any other page through a global horizontal navigation bar, always visible in the top of the browser window. This allows users to retain an overview of the website structure at all times, and leaves freedom to move about and find any information quickly. All pages also feature a similar navigation footer in the bottom. The low number of pages makes the navigation bars easy to scan and directly corresponds to the areas of information the client wants to convey, as well as the amount of information within them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the content of specific pages links to other related pages. This makes up a local and more content driven level of navigation. For example, the different sections of the home page link to all of the other pages in turn, while both Kantine, Catering and Om Da Carlo logically have a bottom contact banner linking to the contact page.
          </p>

      <section id="brand">
        <h2>Page Layout &amp;&nbsp;Appearance</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The page will have an universal graphic appearance to show the users that they are still on the same website. This will consist of the same fonts, same effect on pictures and layout principles. It is important to us that we keep in mind our clients value words that he wants the website to match:
          </p>
          <h3>Value words</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Latin</li>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Exciting experience</li>
            <li>Memorable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The website should feel personal, warm and genuine. It should communicate that the food is made by ingredients of high quality, by chefs who are delighted to make outstanding food. The website should communicate the chefs’ personalities. It is not the kind of business that will use “highclass”, “feinsmecker” words to describe their food. It is real, genuine food, made by real, genuine chefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company already has a logo and a limited style guide including colors and some graphical elements. They want to keep the logo, but we are free to explore the aesthetic possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moodboard shows an overall look of a possible aesthetic direction for the website.
          </p>
          <h3>Moodboard</h3>

            <img src="img/moodboard_DaCarlo.png" alt="moodboard" />

          </figure>
          <div class="full-width">
            <div class="left">
              <h3>Layout</h3>
              <p>
                We want longer, but fewer pages to avoid too many clicks. All pages of our website consist of some common content. This includes the logo of Da Carlo Catering, which will be displayed on the top of every page. Behind the logo will be a photograph, “Main Picture” this will be different for every page, but have in common that they work as the background for the whole page, not changing as the user scrolls down the page. On the main page, the main picture will also be a picture carousel. The height of the image will always be the height of the viewport, minus the navbar. The picture will be centered on the page, so that the center of the image is visible on smaller displays.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was important for our client that the website provide clear and easy access to the information about Da Carlo as a company and the services that they provide. We have placed the navigation bar under the main picture to give a clear overview of what this website contains as well as easy access to the different underlying pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to create a wow-factor for Da Carlo’s potential customers, and we think by designing a modern layout with information in boxes that slide over bigger pictures, we will capture the users eyes compared to other catering firms’ websites. Some of the boxes will have a texture to make the information “pop”. Although it is important that the page don’t feel dated, we want to reach out to a broad audience and we want to make the design feel including.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every page will include the navbar, a segment about contact information and a footer. The only exception here is the “Kontakt oss” page where the contact information naturally will take up not just a segment of the page, but the whole page. The fact that contact information is available on all the pages of the site will help fulfill the goal of making contact information easily accessible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The page will be responsive in the way that the navbar should become a hamburger menu when the viewport is less than a smartphone: 344px (or percentage). The boxes will then fill the viewport, however you can still see the main picture in the background as the boxes scroll over it.

              <strong>Colours:</strong> HEX: #009998 : Turqoise, as a contrast colour to be able to control the users focus on the page. This is the colour that is in Da Carlo’s logo. <br>
              <strong>Text:</strong> We want the pictures to speak for themselves so we don’t want the text be too long on each page.<br>
              <strong>Filters: </strong>The main pictures will be different on each page. However, the pictures will have a dark filter to make the logo “pop” and to have a continuous “feel” throughout the whole webpage.

            Together with the client we have developed a sitemap for the website. The website should be easy to navigate in as the users are not necessarily especially tech interested. The sitemap is divided into two types of content: The core content provides information of Da Carlo's services, while the supporting content addresses the business itself.

          <h3>2. About</h3>
          <p>
            Short text about Da Carlo as business, what they want to deliver. What the customers should expect from them.
