        <h2>The client</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We will work with Da Carlo catering. They are a small firm located in Oslo providing catering for people. They deliver delicious Mediterranean and South American food. They are also in a search for a bigger company where they could start making a canteen operational.           </p>
          <p>
            They are a small group of professional chefs that take great pride in delivering delicious, savory food with inspiration from their home country. The chefs are born in Chile, Uruguay and Italy and they have brought their food traditions to Norway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our main contact is Lene Harbo, who handles the administrative operations. The manager, Juan Carlos Pequeno, will also give feedback on the website.

        <h2>Goal &amp; Purpouse</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Until now, Da Carlo have only marketed themselves through word of mouth, but from now on they are focusing on expanding their business by increasing the number of sales. As a part of their marketing strategy they would like to create a website that will give them a presence in the digital world. This will make it easier for potential customers to understand who they are and what they can deliver. Through the website the customers will be assured that Da Carlo will give a great food experience. The website will also make it easier for customers to get in contact with Da Carlo and share it with friends, colleagues and family.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a catering business they want to distinguish themselves by giving a full experience, not just food in aluminium baskets. The chefs deliver the food themselves, they present their own artwork with pride and joy for the whole party. They want to deliver great food experiences, with a total experience that gives the customer a wow-feeling and a feeling that they are taken care of.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical goals</h3>
          <h4>The website must:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Be responsive, and adapt to pc screens as well as modern smart phones</li>
            <li>Have satisfactory page-load performance, maximum 1 second (with 12Mbps as a benchmark connection speed)</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>Content goals</h3>
          <h4>The website must:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide clear and easily accessible information about Da Carlo as a company, the services they offer and how to contact them</li>
            <li>Be written in Norwegian</li>
            <li>Make use of the original logo</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>… should:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Assure potential customers that Da Carlo delivers not only great food, but full wow-factor food experiences</li>
            <li>Be visually appealing to a broad range of users</li>
            <li>Communicate Da Carlos personality and core values</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>… could:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Offer an effective channel of communication between customers and Da Carlo, i.e a contact form</li>
            <li>Be available in English</li>

        <h2>Aesthetic &amp;&nbsp;Brand</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The client wants to capture a large user group with the website design and appearance. The website should persuade the customers that Da Carlo will give them great food for their special happening.
          </p>
          <h3>Value words</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Latin</li>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Exciting experience</li>
            <li>Memorable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The website should feel personal, warm and genuine. It should communicate that the food is made by ingredients of high quality, by chefs who are delighted to make outstanding food. The website should communicate the chefs’ personalities. It is not the kind of business that will use “highclass”, “feinsmecker” words to describe their food. It is real, genuine food, made by real, genuine chefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company already has a logo and a limited style guide including colors and some graphical elements. They want to keep the logo, but we are free to explore the aesthetic possibilities.

            Da Carlo delivers a bit of luxury and enjoyment to people on their special event. To better describe what kind of people the client wants to reach out to, we made three different personas. Personas are a description of a person that represents the customers different market segmentations. They will help us as designers to map out the different needs of the different kind of customers.
          </p>
          <h3>Personas</h3>

        <h2>Content &amp; Structure</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Together with the client we have developed a sitemap for the website. The website should be easy to navigate in as the users are not necessarily especially tech interested. The sitemap is divided into two types of content: The core content provides information of Da Carlo's services, while the supporting content addresses the business itself.
          </p>

            <figcaption>Proposed sitemap</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>1. Homepage</h3>
          <p>
            Must inspire customers, make them hungry for savory delicious food. Include pictures of ingredients and food. Communicate Da Carlos passion for food and great experiences. Could it communicate both the catering services and the canteen possibility? With main focus on catering. If possible, it would be nice if the canteen also could have some priority on the homepage.
          </p>
          <h3>2. About</h3>
          <p>
            Short text about Da Carlo as business, what they want to deliver. What the customers should expect from them. This information should be relevant both for catering and the canteen, because the Da Carlo experience will be the same. Emphasize the authenticity and the passion they have for food.
          </p>
          <h4>2.1. About the chefs</h4>
          <p>
            Introduction of the four chefs with picture and short text to create a feeling of a personal bond between the customers and Da Carlo Catering.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Catering</h3>
          <p>
            Information on how exactly the delivery will happen, emphasize that the chefs deliver the food and the experience. Communicate that they deliver three-course dinner, finger food, desserts, latin barbeques and specialize in tapas. However they will customize to the customer’s needs and the specific event. If the event requires it, they can also bring professional waiters and bartenders.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Menu</h3>
          <p>
            Listing of the menu. There might be different packages to choose from, but these are not specified yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communicate the different possibilities, but include that customizing is possible.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Canteen</h3>
          <p>
            Information about the possibility for Da Carlo to work in a canteen. Communicate that the manager has a long experience working and operating a Norwegian canteen for a big company.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Should include a short reference to earlier work cooperation written by the other company (Nets), because they have been very pleased with the food and how it is operated.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Contact information</h3>
          <p>
            Should be easily accessible. Because of the personal experience. Just call. Or email. Maybe there could be a form to fill out, but this should be very simple and short, so that the focus is on the personal communication.
