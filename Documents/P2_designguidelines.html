		  <p>
			We will work with Da Carlo catering. They are a small firm located in Oslo providing catering for people. They deliver delicious Mediterranean and South American food. They are also in a search for a bigger company where they could start making a canteen operational.           </p>
          <p>
            They are a small group of professional chefs that take great pride in delivering delicious, savory food with inspiration from their home country. The chefs are born in Chile, Uruguay and Italy and they have brought their food traditions to Norway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our main contact is Lene Harbo, who handles the administrative operations. The manager, Juan Carlos Pequeno, will also give feedback on the website.

        <h2>Goal, Audience &amp; Purpose</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The website’s purpose is to give Da Carlo a presence in the digital world, as part of a marketing strategy to expand their business by increasing the number of sales. Thus, our goal is to inform potential customers of who Da Carlo are, what they can deliver and how to contact them. We also want to help Da Carlo distinguish themselves and assure their audience that they deliver not only great food, but full food experiences. The main audience will be people who demand a little extra luxury on their special event - organizers both of business events and of private parties of different sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a catering business they want to distinguish themselves by giving a full experience, not just food in aluminium baskets. The chefs deliver the food themselves, they present their own artwork with pride and joy for the whole party. They want to deliver great food experiences, with a total experience that gives the customer a wow-feeling and a feeling that they are taken care of.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical goals</h3>
          <h4>The website must:</h4>

            <li>Require maximum 3 clicks to reach any page</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Content goals</h3>
          <h4>The website must:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide clear and easily accessible information about Da Carlo as a company, the services they offer and how to contact them</li>
            <li>Be written in Norwegian</li>

          </ul>
          <h4>… should:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Assure potential customers that Da Carlo delivers not only great food, but full wow-factor food experiences</li>

          </ul>
          <h4>… could:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Offer an effective channel of communication between customers and Da Carlo, i.e a contact form</li>

        <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Navigation of Da Carlo’s website is concise and effective. The site comprises of five main pages: Hjem, Kantine, Kontakt, Om DaCarlo and Catering. All of these can be reached from any other page through a global horizontal navigation bar, always visible in the top of the browser window. This allows users to retain an overview of the website structure at all times, and leaves freedom to move about and find any information quickly. All pages also feature a similar navigation footer in the bottom. The low number of pages makes the navigation bars easy to scan and directly corresponds to the areas of information the client wants to convey, as well as the amount of information within them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the content of specific pages links to other related pages. This makes up a local and more content driven level of navigation. For example, the different sections of the home page link to all of the other pages in turn, while both Kantine, Catering and Om Da Carlo logically have a bottom contact banner linking to the contact page.
          </p>

        <h2>Page Layout &amp;&nbsp;Appearance</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The page will have an universal graphic appearance to show the users that they are still on the same website. This will consist of the same fonts, same effect on pictures and layout principles. It is important to us that we keep in mind our clients value words that he wants the website to match:
          </p>
          <h3>Value words</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal</li>
            <li>Latin</li>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Exciting experience</li>
            <li>Memorable</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The website should feel personal, warm and genuine. It should communicate that the food is made by ingredients of high quality, by chefs who are delighted to make outstanding food. The website should communicate the chefs’ personalities. It is not the kind of business that will use “highclass”, “feinsmecker” words to describe their food. It is real, genuine food, made by real, genuine chefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company already has a logo and a limited style guide including colors and some graphical elements. They want to keep the logo, but we are free to explore the aesthetic possibilities.
          </p>
          <h3>Moodboard</h3>

          <p>
            Together with the client we have developed a sitemap for the website. The website should be easy to navigate in as the users are not necessarily especially tech interested. The sitemap is divided into two types of content: The core content provides information of Da Carlo's services, while the supporting content addresses the business itself.

            <figcaption>Proposed sitemap</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>1. Homepage</h3>
          <p>
            Must inspire customers, make them hungry for savory delicious food. Include pictures of ingredients and food. Communicate Da Carlos passion for food and great experiences. Could it communicate both the catering services and the canteen possibility? With main focus on catering. If possible, it would be nice if the canteen also could have some priority on the homepage.
          </p>
          <h3>2. About</h3>
          <p>
            Short text about Da Carlo as business, what they want to deliver. What the customers should expect from them. This information should be relevant both for catering and the canteen, because the Da Carlo experience will be the same. Emphasize the authenticity and the passion they have for food.
          </p>
          <h4>2.1. About the chefs</h4>
          <p>
            Introduction of the four chefs with picture and short text to create a feeling of a personal bond between the customers and Da Carlo Catering.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Catering</h3>
          <p>
            Information on how exactly the delivery will happen, emphasize that the chefs deliver the food and the experience. Communicate that they deliver three-course dinner, finger food, desserts, latin barbeques and specialize in tapas. However they will customize to the customer’s needs and the specific event. If the event requires it, they can also bring professional waiters and bartenders.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Menu</h3>
          <p>
            Listing of the menu. There might be different packages to choose from, but these are not specified yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communicate the different possibilities, but include that customizing is possible.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Canteen</h3>
          <p>
            Information about the possibility for Da Carlo to work in a canteen. Communicate that the manager has a long experience working and operating a Norwegian canteen for a big company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pride and joy in making savory food with inspiration from their home countries. It’s tasty and different every day. Will deliver that extra experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should include a short reference to earlier work cooperation written by the other company (Nets), because they have been very pleased with the food and how it is operated.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Contact information</h3>
          <p>
            Should be easily accessible. Because of the personal experience. Just call. Or email. Maybe there could be a form to fill out, but this should be very simple and short, so that the focus is on the personal communication.
